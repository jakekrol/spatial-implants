experiment: model gene expression as a function of spatial distance from implant site
goals:
    - load data into loupe browser
        - https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE202425
    - get a few sig. diff. exp. genes to analyze from publication
        - https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnins.2022.937923/full#h7
        - Fig2
        - see acute_stim_de_genes.tsv
        - focus on the first 6
        - assign spots to groups based on
            - projection, distance to implant
