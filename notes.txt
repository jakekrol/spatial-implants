experiment: model gene expression as a function of spatial distance from implant site
goals:
    - load data into loupe browser
        - https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE202425
    - get a few sig. diff. exp. genes to analyze from publication
        - https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnins.2022.937923/full#h7
        - Fig2
        - see acute_stim_de_genes.tsv
        - focus on the first 6
        - assign spots to groups based on
            - projection, distance to implant

summary:
- clustered spots by distance for acute stimulated (4A, [row 2 in fig2 of pub])
- recorded log normalized expression of gene(sets) and averaged by distance clustered
    - see google sheets
- screenshotted
    - control/acute expression spot by visium
    - distribution of expression over distance
- uploaded cloupe files to lab folder on google drive

next steps
- do simple linear reg of expression for the gene(sets) recorded
- update Ryan and Erin on result
